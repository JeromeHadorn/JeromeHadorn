### Hi there I'm JeromeðŸ‘‹
I am currently enrolled as a second-year computer science student at the University of Zurich whilst working as an Analyst for CoreStream Ltd in a technical and analytical role.

I have a wide-ranging set of interests computation, software engineering, business & finance, neurology, and philosophy that I try to incorporate when choosing my courses, at work, and in my free time.
